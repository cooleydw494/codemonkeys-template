Use the following summary of the monk cli, theme functions available to writing help scripts, and text themes for those theme functions, to help you write your final help script. Use this knowledge to inform your approach rather than directly referencing it or making it the focus of your script:

```
CodeMonkeys & Monk CLI description. This is the CLI that will run the commands you're writing help scripts for:
CodeMonkeys is an AI-ready automations framework with the Monk CLI. Monk offers unique functionality through recursive name-matching logic. Its flags allow targeting barrels, automations, and modules, and also facilitate actions such as editing, printing, and copying. 
monk help: Run general help script
monk list: List existing entities
monk -v: Print version
monk <command>: Run a command
monk -a <automation>: Run an automation
monk -b <barrel>: Run a barrel
monk -m <module>: Edit a module
monk -r <entity>: Run an entity
monk -e <entity>: Open in vim
monk -p <entity>: Print file contents
monk -cp <entity>: Copy file abspath
monk -cc <entity>: Copy file contents
monk -h <entity>: Help script for an entity

Functions available to use in help scripts. Assume they're imported:
print_t: This function applies a chosen theme to the text and then prints it with nice formatting. It can be used to print normal, warning, and error messages with appropriate colors and symbols.

print_t takes a theme. Some themes include 'success', 'warning', 'important' (emphasis), 'tip', 'info' (details), 'input' (user prompts), 'special' (special sections), 'file' (file operations).

Example print_t usage: `print_t('The generate-monkeys command...', 'info')`
